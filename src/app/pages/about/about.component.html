      THIS APP WAS CONCEIVED AS A SOFT, DIFFUSE AND DEPENDENT PERFORMING HACKING
      DEVICE. IT IS A PART OF A WIDER ART PROJECT BY SOFIA DURRIEU WE UNDERSTAND
      SYSTEMS TO BE UNAVOIDABLE, ESSENTIAL TOOLS. THEY ARE THE GUARANTORS OF THE
      WAY WE HAVE INVENTED, IN ORDER TO EXIST IN A COMPLEX <br>–AND SO FREQUENTLY
      OVERWHELMING- WORLD. IN TIME, WE HAVE MADE OF RULES AND FUNCTIONALITY OUR
      NATURAL HABITAT, EVENTUALLY CONSTRAINING OURSELVES TO THE STATUS OF
      INSTRUMENTS. A DEFINED, PREDETERMINED LOGIC IS NECESSARY, “ORGANISING” OUR
      PERCEPTION <br>-AND THEREFORE OUR CONNECTIONS- INTO KNOWN, OUT OF ORDER IS AN
      ATTEMPT TO DISTURB THE AUTOMATIC OBEDIENCE TO THE TACIT RULES THAT
      CONSTANTLY REGULATE OUR PERCEPTION, BODY AND BEHAVIOUR ON DAILY BASES.
      THROUGH A SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTIONS, IT AIMS TO “TURN THE TOOL AGAINST ITSELF”.
      OR AT LEAST, TO BEND IT A BIT. IT IS SHAMELESSLY DEPENDENT: TO FULLY APPEAR,
      THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE VISITOR IS ESSENTIAL, THUS REVEALING CONNECTION AND
      PARTICIPATION AS A CONDITION FOR (ITS) EXISTENCE. IN THE APP, THAT SAME
      INTENTION IS MAINTAINED. FOR SYNTHESIS/MENU PURPOSES, WE HAVE CALLED THE
      SMALL ACTIONS THAT IT PROPOSES, “MISSIONS”. BUT THEY ARE REALLY NOT. THEY
      ARE JUST REMINDERS, A MINI-GATEWAY, A SYMBOLIC CRACK TO TINGLE A BIT THE
      GRID OF THE STANDARD. <br>- OUTOFORDER TOOK THE FORM OF AN EXHIBITION DURING THE
      MONTH OF AUGUST 2020, SIMULTANEOUSLY IN KUNSTHAUS BASELLAND, ON THE FHNW HG
      CAMPUS AND IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY OF BASEL, SWITZERLAND. A FEW MONTHS
      LATER, IT CONTINUED IN THE CONTEXT OF “MI VEREDA”, IN BUENOS AIRES,
      ARGENTINA. TO SEE MORE: HTTPS://VIMEO.COM/456092433 THE APP WAS PROGRAMMED
      BY TOMAS CICCOLA THE OUTOFORDER PROJECT AND APP WERE CONCEIVED AND DEVELOPED
      BY YOURS TRULY, SOFIA DURRIEU. WWW.SOFIADURRIEU.COM
